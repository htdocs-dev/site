Segregate IPs

Don't send bulk/marketing email from the same IPs you use to send user mail, transactional mail, alerts, etc. Each IP you send from has a reputation. By segregating your IPs according to function, you help ensure that your mail receives the best delivery possible.

If you send both promotional mail and transactional mail relating to your organization, we recommend separating mail by purpose as much as possible. You can do this by:

Using separate email addresses for each function.
Sending mail from different domains and/or IP addresses for each function.

Update: For future reference, the problem was in /etc/mailname which listed a name that wasn't in the mydestinations list of postfix. This caused all mails to be considered foreign and the mail bypassed /etc/aliases processing
